<h4>Overview of Programs</h4>
<p>The Clayton State University Master of Science in Psychology programs are unique in that they are designed as a terminal or professional master’s degrees that combines a heavily applied community oriented training model with extensive research preparation. Our degree programs are members of the <a href= "https://universityconsortium.srcd.org" target="_blank">University Based Child and Family Policy Consortium</a> and the <a href= "http://www.camppsite.org" target="_blank">Council of Applied Master Programs in Psychology</a>.



<h4>Master of Science in Clinical/Counseling Psychology</h4>
<p>The mission of the Master’s program in Clinical/Counseling Psychology is to prepare students to be
competent, ethical practitioners of psychological services in the community. Students will develop skills
in psychological assessment, and in a variety of therapeutic modalities, including adult and child
individual, family, couples, and group therapy. Students will be able to apply knowledge from various
theoretical frameworks (e.g., cognitive, behavioral, psychodynamic, humanistic) to intervene effectively
with a wide variety of psychological problems. The program emphasizes learning to consider the
uniqueness of each individual and the influence of culture and ethnicity when providing services to
people from diverse backgrounds. Students will be expected to develop self-awareness, empathy, and
compassion for the people struggling with mental health problems. This program will prepare graduates
to work in a broad range of mental health settings. The program will also prepare students who wish to
pursue doctoral training in clinical or counseling psychology.</p>

<h4>Master of Science in Psychology (Applied Developmental)</h4>
<p>The mission of the Master’s program in Applied Developmental Psychology is to provide
students with advanced knowledge in normative and atypical patterns of development and the critical
contexts of development. Moreover, students will develop skills for assessing and monitoring
development and devising, implementing, and evaluating programs that serve increasingly diverse
populations of children and adolescents. The program offers a unique emphasis on the application of
knowledge in community settings and prepares students for immediate employment in a range of
settings including government and non-profit agencies, research centers, and parent education
programs. The program will also prepare students who wish to pursue doctoral training in applied
developmental psychology, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, and educational psychology.</p>
