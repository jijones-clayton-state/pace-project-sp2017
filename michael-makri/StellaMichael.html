	<h2>Hello and Welcome to Dr. Stella Michael-Makri's webpage!<br> A little bit about myself:</h2>
	
<p>I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Psychology at Kennesaw State University, and relocated to the Dallas Texas area to complete my graduate studies. I attended Texas Woman’s University where I earned my Master’s in Clinical Mental Health Counseling and completed my doctorate at Texas A&M University in Counselor Education and Supervision.<br></p> 

<p>I have been teaching for the past 10 years and I absolutely love it! Not only do I get to teach you but you are teaching me as well, as I learn so much from your experiences, views and thoughts! I have taught at Texas A&M and at Longwood University (VA). I moved to GA in 2014 when I was offered a faculty position at CSU. Apart from an educator, I am also a Licensed Professional Counselor and have worked in various environments, such as schools (providing Play Therapy and group counseling), Juvenile Detention Center (run substance abuse groups), Hospital (rehabilitation therapist), and clinics providing individual, group, family and couples therapy. I have a part-time practice and I mainly work with diverse populations as it is one of my areas of expertise as well as research interests. I am also actively serving on committees in professional organizations (both on a state and national level) and have been presenting on both levels.<br></p> 

<p>My hobbies and interests include spending quality time with my family, practicing mindfulness and working out, as well as traveling and enjoying life in general! I lived in Cyprus for my first 22 years of life and have traveled to Greece, England, Germany, France, and Holland. In United States, I lived in Texas and Virginia and vacationed in several others but still, Georgia is my favorite!<br></p>  

<p>That's me in a nutshell! If you have questions  or need assistance please do not hesitate to contact me. 

Cheers! 

Dr. Makri</p>
